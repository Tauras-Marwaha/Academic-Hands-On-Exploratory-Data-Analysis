# Academic-Hands-On-Exploratory-Data-Analysis
A Hands on academic exercise around the fundamentals of exploratory data analysis

Language: Python 3

Course: Intelligent Data Analysis (CS 6052) taught by Dr. Gowtham Atluri

Goal: Learn, implement, evaluate and reason out **summary statistics results, interpret geometric and probailistic Views, understand covariance matrix, dimensionality reduction - feature selection, principal component analysis on the Iris Data Set, singular value decomposition and linear discriminant analysis**

Data: Multiple datasets with two classes.

Approach: We have been provided with the datasets and interesting questions that need to be answered by understanding the fundamentals of different algorithms. A sample practice module was also provided by the professor to guide us with some sample codes and help us getting started.

Acknowledgement: This assignment was designed by Dr. Gowtham Atluri as a part of requirement for CS 6052 - Intelligent Data Analysis course, taught at the University of Cincinnati.
